      <description>Rule Use nullptr rather than 0 or NULL.
Reason  Readability. Because C++ define NULL is an const type int has value 0, that can lead to wrong in some situations like the following example. Minimize surprises: nullptr cannot be confused with an int, since it is defined as a null pointer.
 Therefore, nullptr has a well-specified (very restrictive) type, and thus works in more scenarios where type deduction might do the wrong thing on NULL or 0 .</description>
